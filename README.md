# 👋 Hey there, I’m Randy (rvndyr)

I’m a **Systems Development Engineer** currently working at **Jamf**.  
I’m passionate about **DevOps and full-stack development** — and I love learning and building new things.

## 💼 What I Do / My Background

- I work with **AWS EKS / Kubernetes + Helm + ArgoCD** to deploy and manage scalable applications in production-grade environments.  
- I’ve recently been working on projects involving **Sentry + ClickHouse + Redis** integrations for scalable error tracking and observability.  
- I also enjoy building backend services using **Python / FastAPI**, and writing tools using the **OpenAI API** (for example, see my `commit-summary` repo).  
- On the front-end side, I’ve used **React + styled-components** and **Vue** in some of my personal projects.
